1) create a user registration for where a user can enter his email, password, dob and  username in a react component. 
on clicking register you have to register the user by saving details in backend
create a backend api which can save the user in backend. Make sure you hash the password.

2) it is obvius that many ppl will enter an existing username or email id. so you have to create a backend custom validator 
which will check if the username or email id already exists or not.if username or email exists then dont let user register. send error to front end. 

3) Now it will be irritating for user to submit all details and then finally get to know that username or email exists.
so we will this time create a check username button next to username input box. on clicking check username, it will make a request to backend and 
check if username exist or not. if username exist then display a message in red font above the form that user exists. 

For the above functionality to work you have to create a api also which will accept username as a param and return you if user exist or not. 
if user doesnt exist then it will return _{status:1, msg:"user doesnt exist"} . if user exists return {status:0, debug_data:"user exists"}

create same api to check if email exists or not and do the same as you do for username. means add a button next to username input box for user to check.
