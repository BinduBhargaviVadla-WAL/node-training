1)Create a React Component where you can login with the previous login api you created. 
This time after you login, you will redirect the route in react to /members. 
Note: "/members" route is protected route. means only those who are successfully logged in can view it.
on going to "/members" page you will show all details of the user. 
Note: on sucessful login you will save the token in localStorage.
2) create a Logout componet which you will show on the top right. the Logout component will show a logout button. 
on clicking of this button, u will delete the jwt token from local storage. 

3) create a api for editing user details like name,age,dob and password. in react you will create a component called EditUser and on this component you will show a form where you will show all details pre populated. 
now you will send request to backend to modify the details.
Note: send jwt token in header using axios.you can google search how to send headers in axios. 
like this 
axios.get('https://example.com/getSomething', {
 headers: {
   token: "Asdfasdfas13123123"
 }
})
Keep in mind that all api that need user to be logged in should contain the middleware to verify jwt token.
