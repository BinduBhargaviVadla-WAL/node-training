1) Create a file managment application. 
you will create api to create a file where you can enter the fileName and file contents.
then you will create the file in a directory called files. files directory should be in westsidenodeapp folder 

you will create a react component in front end where you will send the name of file and contents. 
2) you will create a api to create a folder in the files folder. you will send the folder name. 
you will create a react component called CreateFolder which will create the folder. 

3) you will create a FolderContents component in react which will show contents of all files in a list. 
you will create a backend where you wll send all files in the folder. 
you have to add a delete button next to every file listing. on clicking the delete button, that file should be deleted and your
 list should be updated(for that you have to again send request to get updated contents of the file)

4)create a component where you can enter the name of the file in a text box and it will show the contents of the file in a textarea.
 the reason is that you will have one more button called modify. in the text area you can modify the contents and if you click on modify,
 it will send the content to server and modify the contents( note: you are modifiying not appending so dont use append function)
