1) create a user table in mysql.
the fields are username(varchar(25)), password(varchar(100)),date_of_creation(date)

note: date_of_creation is the date when user is created.

create api to create user, edit user, read user and delete user. 

in create user you have to put a condition where you will find if the given  username exist or not. 
If the username exists then send message saying {status:0, debug_data:"username already exists"} . 
if the username doesnt exit then create the user and send message {status:1, data:"user created"}

Now create API "/checklogin" where you will provide a username and password. 
If username and password is correct then it will return {status:1, data:username}  means user is logged in,
 else you return {status:0, data:"incorrect login details"}
here you will set 2 session values when username and password is correct. 
 isLoggedIn  if user has sent right username and password, 0 if username or password dont match) 
 username you will store the username in this value. you may need it in other functions.


2) create API which will show all details of user. But this api should only send data if user is logged in. 
how will you find which username details to show? simple you have stored username and isLoggedIn in the session variable. 
from that u can find username and send all details of user which is userid, password, etc

if user is not notted in then send {status:0, debug_data:"you are not logged in "} else you will send {status:1, data:userOb}.
userOb in data value is the object that has all user properties
