It is advised to refer to mongoose documentation to find right function for a requirement.https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html

1) Create a Categories API with mongoose. 
Fields are name,description. create CRUD API(create,read,update and delete). 

Next link the category to book model like we did author in book model. 
Now you need to create api where you will show details of both author and category in the response with url as localhost:3000/book/authorandcategory. To get both u need to write code as :
	Book.find()
		.populate("author")
		.populate("cagegory")
		.exec(...)

2) create API to get book details by id. ur url should be localhost:3000/bookid and you should be able to get book details. 
refer to documentation of mongoose for it. 

3)1)Create a Ecommerce API.
you need to have 1 collection.
Products: should have name,price, avaialability(available/not available)
you need to create 4 end points
post url localhost:3000/product will create product. 
get url localhost:3000/product -- show all products as json
delete url localhost:3000/product/id
localhost/product/id -->send json for only that product.
edit url:localhost/product/id -->send json response that product is modified.

findbyproduct url
